I have created a news site: "World of AI". The assignment was to create a responsive site using flexbox to layout the page.  

First I took a couple of days just to think about what I was going to create. I made a scetch in Miro, downloaded images and watched instruction videos from Technigo.The problems I faced when starting coding was firstly how to layout the cards. It took me some time to figure out how to get the cards in a row on a desktop screen and 2 rows on a tablet. I googled a lot, read about flexbox and finally I managed to do it. 

I realised when I was done with everything that it did not look perfect in mobile device (I looked in the inspector tool and chose different mobile phones). I guess this was because during my working process I scaled my site to a minimum, believing this was a mobile view. but I guess I should have used the inspector tool for that.
